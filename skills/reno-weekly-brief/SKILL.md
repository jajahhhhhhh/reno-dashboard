# Reno Weekly Brief

Produce a structured weekly recap. Heavier than `reno-status` — this is narrative, looks at trends, and proposes priorities. Use on Mondays (forward-looking) and Fridays (backward-looking) by default.

## Inputs

Read `./CONFIG.md` for sites, contractor, currency, language.

Read all three data sources:
- `~~dashboard-path/dashboard-final.html` → `SAMPLE_TASKS`, `SAMPLE_PAYMENTS`
- `~~dashboard-path/inventory-system.html` → `SAMPLE_ITEMS`

## Steps

### 1. Determine the window

From the user's request and `currentDate`:
- "Friday recap" / "end of week" → window is **Mon → today**
- "Monday brief" → window is **last Mon → Sun (the week just finished)**, also surface upcoming week
- "this week" → Mon → Sun of current week
- "last week" → previous Mon → Sun
- Default if ambiguous: previous 7 days ending on `currentDate`

Compute the absolute date range and state it in the output header.

### 2. Compute per-site sections

For each configured site (`~~site-a`, `~~site-b`):

**Done this week** — tasks with `s: 'Done'`. (Note: we don't have completion timestamps in the schema, so use the `date` field if set, otherwise count by current status snapshot. Caveat in the output if so.)

**Money paid this week** — payments with `date` in window AND `status: 'paid'`. Sum, list top 3 by amount.

**Money committed (approved/pending)** — payments not paid in window. Sum, list top 1–2.

**Slipping** — tasks with `pri: 'High'` AND `s: 'Todo'` for more than 7 days (or no obvious progress). Tasks with `date < currentDate` and `s != 'Done'`.

**In flight** — count of `s: 'In Progress'` and `s: 'Review'`.

### 3. Cross-site section

- Total paid this week (both sites combined)
- Largest pending payment overall
- Any stock now out / critically low

### 4. Top 3 for next week

Rank candidates for "next week's focus" by:
1. High priority + Todo for 7+ days → must do
2. Pending payments where work is blocked → must act on
3. In Progress for 14+ days → likely stuck, needs unblock

Pick 3, no more. Be specific — "decide on tile pattern for Chaweng kitchen" not "make decisions".

### 5. Format the output

In `~~language`. For Thai (default), use this shape:

```
📊 สรุปสัปดาห์ {Mon DD — Sun DD}

🏠 {~~site-a}
   ✅ เสร็จ {n} งาน: {list 2-3 highlights}
   💰 จ่ายไป {~~currency-symbol}{paid_this_week}: {top 2-3 line items}
   🔧 กำลังทำ {n} · รอเริ่ม {n}
   ⚠️ ค้าง: {1-2 specific items, or "ไม่มีงานค้าง"}

🏢 {~~site-b}
   {same structure}

🌐 ภาพรวม
   จ่ายรวมสัปดาห์: {~~currency-symbol}{total}
   ค้างจ่าย: {~~currency-symbol}{total} — {largest single item}
   สต็อก: {n} หมด, {n} ใกล้หมด

🎯 อาทิตย์หน้า ต้องลุย 3 เรื่องนี้
   1. {specific actionable item, site-labeled}
   2. {specific actionable item}
   3. {specific actionable item}
```

For English, equivalent labels: Done / Paid / In flight / Slipping / Big picture / Next week.

Keep total length under 400 words. Bulleted/structured, never paragraphs.

### 6. Offer follow-ups

Add a one-line suggestion at the bottom:

> "Want me to log next week's plan as tasks? Just say so."

Or:

> "Big pending payment to {vendor} — `reno-log-money` if you've approved it."

## What NOT to do

- Don't show data the user can derive at a glance (e.g., "total tasks: 47") — focus on what changed and what to do.
- Don't praise progress with empty phrases ("great work this week!"). The user wants signal, not pep.
- Don't reuse `reno-status` output. This is narrative; `reno-status` is a snapshot.
- Don't pretend to know completion dates if the schema doesn't track them. Be honest: "based on current status (no completion timestamp in data)".
- If `~~site-b` is single-site mode (blank or "(single-site mode)" in CONFIG.md), produce a single combined section, not two.
