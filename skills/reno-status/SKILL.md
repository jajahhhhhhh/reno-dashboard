# Reno Status

Produce a fast snapshot of the renovation project state. Read-only. This is the "tell me what's happening right now" skill — use a heavier skill like `reno-weekly-brief` for narrative reports.

## Inputs

Read `./CONFIG.md` from the working directory. If missing, fall back to assuming the dashboard files are in the working directory and use generic site labels ("Site A", "Site B"). Note the degraded state in the output.

## Steps

### 1. Read the dashboard files

From `~~dashboard-path`:
- Read `dashboard-final.html` — extract the `SAMPLE_TASKS` array and `SAMPLE_PAYMENTS` array.
- Read `inventory-system.html` — extract the `SAMPLE_ITEMS` array.

Use `Read` directly on the HTML files. The arrays are embedded as JavaScript literals inside `<script>` tags — parse them out by locating the `const SAMPLE_TASKS = [` and `const SAMPLE_PAYMENTS = [` markers (and `SAMPLE_ITEMS` in inventory) and reading until the matching `];`.

### 2. Compute the snapshot

For each site (per `~~site-a` and `~~site-b`):

- **Tasks**: count by status (Todo / In Progress / Review / Done). Compute % done.
- **Payments**:
  - Total paid (`status === 'paid'`)
  - Total pending (`status !== 'paid'`)
  - Largest 1–2 pending items (vendor + amount)
- **Stock**:
  - Total SKUs
  - Out of stock count (`qty === 0`)
  - Low stock count (`qty > 0 && qty <= minQty`)
  - Top 3 low/out items by recency or criticality

Cross-site:
- Combined paid this month (compare against `currentDate` from session)
- Anything flagged as `pri: 'High'` and not `Done` — these are the things needing attention

### 3. Format the output

Format in the user's `~~language`. For Thai (default), use this structure:

```
📊 ภาพรวมโครงการ — {YYYY-MM-DD}

🏠 {~~site-a}
   งาน: {Done}/{Total} เสร็จ ({%}) · {In Progress} กำลังทำ · {Todo} รอเริ่ม
   เงิน: จ่ายแล้ว {~~currency-symbol}{paid} · ค้าง {~~currency-symbol}{pending}
   {if pending items: "รอจ่าย: {top 1-2 vendors and amounts}"}

🏢 {~~site-b}
   {same structure}

📦 สต็อก
   {total} SKUs · {out_count} หมด · {low_count} ใกล้หมด
   {if any low/out: list top 3 with name + qty}

🚨 ต้องดู
   {bullet list of High-priority undone tasks, or "ไม่มี" if none}
```

For English, use equivalent labels: Tasks / Money / Stock / Needs attention.

Keep the entire snapshot under 200 words. No tables — bullet/line format renders better in chat.

### 4. Suggest one next action

Append a single sentence: the one thing the user should probably do next, inferred from the data. Examples:
- "Big pending payment to MR.HOME — log it once you've transferred?"
- "3 SKUs out of stock — `reno-stock-move` to add the new shipment?"
- "Nothing urgent — good time to clear those 4 Todo tasks?"

## What NOT to do

- Don't make edits. This skill is read-only.
- Don't try to be exhaustive. A snapshot is fast and ruthless about what matters.
- Don't show timestamps for each task or payment — that's noise.
- Don't recompute weekly trends — that's `reno-weekly-brief`.
- If `~~site-b` is "(single-site mode)" in CONFIG.md, skip its section entirely.
