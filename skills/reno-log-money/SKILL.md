# Reno Log Money

Adds or updates entries in the payment ledger (`SAMPLE_PAYMENTS` in `dashboard-final.html`). Also handles ingesting full vendor bills into multiple payment line items.

## Payment schema

```js
{
  id: number,         // unix timestamp or unique
  vendor: string,     // 'MR.HOME', 'HomePro', 'Global House', 'Lazada', etc.
  amount: number,     // in ~~currency (positive)
  status: string,     // 'paid' | 'pending' | 'approved' (awaiting transfer)
  proj: string,       // 'Lipa' | 'Chaweng' | 'Both' — matches ~~site-a/b
  date: string,       // YYYY-MM-DD (date paid OR date due)
  note: string,       // bill # / draw # / purpose
}
```

## Steps

### 1. Load context

Read `./CONFIG.md` for `~~dashboard-path`, sites, `~~currency-symbol`. If missing, ask the user to run `reno-setup`.

Read `~~dashboard-path/dashboard-final.html` and find the `SAMPLE_PAYMENTS = [` block.

### 2. Determine the operation

| Operation | User phrasing |
|---|---|
| **Single payment** | "จ่าย MR.HOME 50000 งวด 2", "I paid HomePro 1250 today" |
| **Mark pending → paid** | "Approved the X payment", "โอนแล้ว MR.HOME งวด 3" |
| **Bill ingest** | User uploads/pastes a multi-line bill (HomePro receipt, Global House invoice) |
| **Add pending/quote** | "MR.HOME quoted 80000 for งวด 4", "got a quote for..." |

### 3. For SINGLE PAYMENT

Parse the amount, vendor, status, project, date, note. If any are missing:
- **Vendor**: required — ask if not stated. Common: MR.HOME, HomePro, Global House, Lazada, Shopee, local hardware store.
- **Amount**: required — ask if not stated. Strip commas, currency symbols.
- **Status**: default to `'paid'` if the user phrased it past-tense ("จ่ายแล้ว", "I paid"); `'pending'` if future-tense ("ต้องจ่าย", "owe", "รอจ่าย"); `'approved'` if the user said they approved a quote but haven't transferred.
- **Project**: default to whichever site was last discussed; if unclear, ask. Use `'Both'` only if the user explicitly says it spans sites.
- **Date**: today (`currentDate` from session) if not given.
- **Note**: leave empty if unknown — don't invent details.

### 4. For BILL INGEST

If the input is a full bill (multiple line items, store header, totals), treat the whole bill as ONE payment entry — not many. The dashboard tracks payments at the bill level, not item level. Item-level detail goes to inventory via `reno-stock-move`.

Extract:
- Vendor = store name (HomePro, Global House)
- Amount = grand total after discounts/VAT
- Date = receipt date
- Note = bill number + brief content summary (e.g., "#6938330 — electrical fittings × 10")

After logging the payment, **offer to also call `reno-stock-move`** to add the bill's line items to inventory. Do NOT do both in one shot without confirming — the user may only want the payment side.

### 5. For MARK PAID

Find the matching pending entry (by vendor + amount + note). If multiple candidates, list and ask. Update `status` to `'paid'` and update `date` to the paid date (today by default).

### 6. Write the change

Use `Edit` on `dashboard-final.html` targeting the `SAMPLE_PAYMENTS` array. Same surgical approach as `reno-update-tasks`:
- Add: insert as last element before the closing `];`
- Update: replace the specific field
- Match the existing formatting style of the file

### 7. Confirm

In `~~language`:

```
✓ บันทึก: {~~currency-symbol}{amount} → {vendor} ({status}, {site})
   ยอดจ่ายแล้ว {site}: {~~currency-symbol}{site_total_paid}
   ค้างจ่าย {site}: {~~currency-symbol}{site_total_pending}
```

Compute the running totals after the edit so the user gets immediate context.

## Edge cases

- **Refunds / negative amounts**: store as a separate entry with `note: 'คืนเงิน'` and a negative `amount` — most rendering code handles this by subtracting from totals.
- **Split bills** (one bill, multiple sites): if the user says "this bill is half for each", create two entries with `proj: '~~site-a'` and `proj: '~~site-b'`, each at half the amount. Note "(split)" in the note field.
- **Currency conversion**: if a user pastes a bill in a different currency than `~~currency`, ask the conversion rate rather than guessing. Don't pull live FX.
- **localStorage drift**: same warning as `reno-update-tasks` — if the user has been actively editing in-browser, our edit to `SAMPLE_PAYMENTS` won't appear unless localStorage is cleared or the user re-imports.
